I am a French student currently doing a MSc in Computing (Security and Reliability) at *Imperial College London*. My home engineering school in France is *Telecom Paris* where I'll graduate in 2019 of a MSc in Engineering.

You'll find on this website [notes]({% link _pages/notes.md %}) I've written -- which include personal writings and lecture notes -- as well as [projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %}) I've developed or been a part of.

My resume is available [here]({% link _pages/resume.md %}). You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-roques) or see my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ojroques) profile.

This domain has two subdomains:
* [git.oroques.dev](https://git.oroques.dev/olivier) which hosts my personal git server.
