## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am currently a junior software engineer at Cisco Systems in France.

Before that, I graduated from [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/secure-software-systems/)
of a MSc in Computing -- Security and Reliability -- in 2019 and from
[Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) of a MSc in Engineering
(*Diplôme d’ingénieur*) in 2020.

You’ll find on this website notes I’ve written (personal writings and lecture
notes) as well as projects I have started or have
participated in.
